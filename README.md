# BlackjackProject
The purpose of this project is to complete a working blackjack game. The cards are dealt to the player and dealer at random after utilizing a shuffle. The cards are tested for blackjack conditions. The user is then prompted to make a choice, hit or stay. Once the user has either busted or decided to stay, then the dealers hand is assessed and he will hit or stay depending on the rules made for the dealer. Once the players and dealers hands are set they are compared to determine a winner.


#Lessons learned
This is the largest object oriented program I had written. I learned a lot about creating and using objects in other classes. With the size and complexity I found that commenting the story of the flow of action helps visualize and put down to code what is actually happening in the game.

#Technologies used
